To compile JavaScript from TypeScript:

```
tsc
```

Just run ^^^^^ from the app's root directory. 

This will also watch for TypeScript changes (i.e. index.ts changed) and automatically generate fresh javascript output.

If you'd like a simple http server for testing, here's what I like:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
```

Just run ^^^^^ from the app's root directory and hit the app in your fav browser at

```
http://localhost
```
